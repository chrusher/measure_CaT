Any publication resulting from the use of this software should cite Usher et al., 2015, MNRAS, 426, 1475 and Cappellari & Emsellem, 2004, PASP, 116, 138. Although modification of this code is encouraged, any publication resulting from the modified code should state that the code has been modified and explain how the code has been modified.



Some of the code was written to be a more general wrapper around pPXF. 

Besides pPXF (available from http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/#ppxf), this code requires Numpy, SciPy and optionally Matplotlib
